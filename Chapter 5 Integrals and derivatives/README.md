# Chapter 5: Integrals and Derivatives

##### Exercise 5.1
This program creates an object called `TrapesiumRuleIntegration`, this object has two methods:
`function_integration`: this method performs an integration on a user-defined global method `f(x)` define before the execution of this object's method.
Within the parameters of this method, one must provide the limits of integration and the number of slices for integration. the more slices the more accurate but the longer it will take to solve. 
`data_integration`: this method performs an integral over the given dataset. Besides providing the dataset, one must specify the number of slices. The maximum amount of slices is the number of data points themselves, this choice then gives the maximum accuracy for the data provided but may take the longest, one may, in turn, provide a smaller amount of slices but accuracy will be sacrificed in the interest of expediency.
