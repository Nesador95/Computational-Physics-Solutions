## Introduction

This project's aim is to provide a sample of my abilities in the form of a challange. The challange is to provide a solution to all exercises in the book [Computational Physics by Mark Newman](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/). 

With my personal solutions I strive to supply an example of my ability in the following areas:

- problem solving 
- translation of mathematical concepts to code
- object oriented design
- mastery of python 
- data visualization
- 3D graphics
- animation
- computational modeling

The original questions and other downloadable material from the book can be found in the link to the author provided above.

## General Synopsis


### Chapter 1: Introduction
Chapter 1 has no exercises and therefore is no feature in this project. The chapter's aim is to intorduce the reader to the underlying concepts that will be covered in the rest of the book.

### Chapter 2: Python programming for physicists 
Chapter 2 introduces different concepts of python programing from variable assignments to user defined functions and regresion methods of calculation. Exercises in this chapter are focused on problem solving and the translation of mathematical equations and physics concepts into code. From problems that cover 2-D kinematics and altitude of satellite orbits to calculating binomial coeficients using "n choose k" with Pascal's Triangle and programing recursive solutions and calculating prime numbers.

### Chapter 3: Graphics and visualization
Chapter 3 introduces methods of data visualization that include graphs, density plots 3-D visualization and Animation.

### Chapter 4: Accuracy and speed
Chapter 4 deals with the limitations of the computer. This chapter deals with methods to estimate accuracy of calculations and how long it would take to compute solutions depending on the amount of steps needed.

### Chapter 5: Integrals and derivatives
Chapter 5 is a first look at computational physics proper with methods for performing integrals and derivatives. The techniques covered include the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule and more advanced methods such as adaptive methods including Romberg integration, and Gaussian quadrature. Some of the applications the author uses for the exercises are: heat capacity of solids, thermal radiation, electrostatics calculations, and image processing. 

### Chapter 6: Solutions to linear and nonlinear equations
Chapter 6, as the title suggests deals with linear and non-linear systems of equations and how to find solutions through a range of different methods. This methods include simultaneous linear equations, eigenvalues and eigen vectors, non-linear equations treatment, and maxima and minima of functions.

### Chapter 7: Fourier transforms
Chapter 7 is focused on topics dealing with the Fourier series such as discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine and sine transforms, and fast Fourier transforms.

### Chapter 8: Ordinary differential equations
Chapter 8 as the title suggests, this chapter focuses on techniques to solve first-order differential equations with one variable, differential equations with more than one variable, second order differential equations, variation of step size, and boundary value problems.

### Chapter 9: Partial differential equations
Chapter 9 builds on the concepts seen in chapter 8 but this time the focuse is on methods to solve partial differentials. These include relaxation methods, and initial value problems. 

### Chapter 10: Random processes and Monte Carlo methods
Chapter 10 focuses on randomness and random processes and how they can be used to solve problems in physics. The methods covered in the chapter include: random numbers generators, seeds, secrete codes, and Gaussian random numbers to name a few; Monte Carlo integration method; Monte Carlo Simulation, Markov chain, and simulation annealing.

### Chapter 11:
Chapter 11 has no exercises and therefore is no feature in this project. The chapter's aim is to provided the reader with topics for further reading and studying.
