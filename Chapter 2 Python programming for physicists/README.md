# Chapter 2 Python Programming for Physicists

##### Exercise 2.1
this program calculates the time it takes for a ball to hit the ground when dropped from a tower of the desired height in meters ignoring air resistance.
##### Exercise 2.2
This program calculates the distance away a satellite needs to be from the surface of the earth to complete the specified period written in seconds.
##### Exercise 2.3
This program will convert cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates.
##### Exercise 2.4
This program calculates the time it takes for a ship traveling in a straight line, at
relativistic speeds, to reach another planet. For the equation's derivation see "Modern Physics For Scientists and Engineers" Second Edition, Chapter 1, section 8.
##### Exercise 2.5
This python program computes the transmission and reflection probabilities of a particle encountering a one-dimensional step in potential energy.
##### Exercise 2.6
This program calculates the orbit of bodies orbiting the Sun by providing the perihelion and the velocity at the perihelion. (If you wish to do another body other than the sun as the center of orbit, go to `velocity_aphelion` and change the mass of the star).
##### Exercise 2.7
This program calculates, in increasing order, all Catalan numbers less than or equal to the specified limit.
##### Exercise 2.8
This is a compilation of the different array operations, as well as matrix operations.
##### Exercise 2.9
This program gives the binding energy for the corresponding atom, the binding energy per nucleon, the value of A of the most stable nucleus and its binding energy per nucleon.
##### Exercise 2.10
This program calculates and prints the Madelung constant for sodium chloride.
##### Exercise 2.11
this program solves n choose k problems.
##### Exercise 2.12
This program finds prime numbers more efficiently than dividing all previous integer by the number being tested. The rules to be followed for this program are:

A) A number is prime if it has no prime factors less than n. Hence we only need to
check if it is divisible by other primes. (ONLY NEED TO DIVIDE BY PRIMES)

B) If a number n is non-prime, having a factor r, then n=rs, where s is also a factor.
If r >= sqrt(n) then n = rs >= sqrt(n)s, which implies that s <= sqrt(n). In other words, any non-prime has to have factors and hence also prime factors, less than or equal to sqrt(n). Thus to determine if a number is prime we have to check its prime factors only up to and including sqrt(n) if there are none then the number is prime. (DIVIDE BY PRIMES UP TO sqrt(n))

C) If we find even a single prime factor less than sqrt(n) that divided n, then we know that the number is non-prime, and hence there is no need to check any further - we can abandon this number and move on to something else. 
##### Exercise 2.13
This program is a rewrite of previous programs and new programs using recursive methods. These methods, although not always faster than non-recursive ones, maybe
the only way to solve certain equations or problems used in math and physics.
