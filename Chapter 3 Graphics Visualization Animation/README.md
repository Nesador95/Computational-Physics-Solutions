# Chapter 3: Graphics and visualization

##### Exercise 3.1
This program was a simple example on how to plot experimental data
and how to manipulate it.
##### Exercise 3.2
This program plots three functions: the deltoid curve, the galilean_spiral, 
and Fey's function. To accomplish this more easily, a polar plot coordinate
convert was also built.
##### Exercise 3.3
This program plots `stm.txt` which contains a grid of values from scanning tunneling
microscope measurements of the surface of silicon. It showsthe structure of the surface
of silicon clearly using a the heatmap method.
##### Exercise 3.4
This program render a sodium chloride crystal arranged on a cubic lattice of the form:
Ch_________Ch
| \       / |
|  \     /  |
|   \   /   |
|    \ /    |
|     Na    | 
|    /  \   |
|   /    \  |
|  /      \ |
| /        \|
Ch__________Ch
using two different colors to represent the two different atoms in 3-D.
This program also builds an fcc crystal lattice. 
##### Exercise 3.5
This program animates a 3-D model of the inner-most planets of the solar system 
with a scale factor to account for size and orbit to aid ease of visualization. This project does not use gravity equations; the spheres have no mass, and their orbits are as circular as the resolution allows. this project intends to showcase some OOD, 3-D modeling and animation as a light-weight representation of the planets with accurate ratios of planetary orbit to Sun's radius and Jupiter radius to planet's radius. The author does not intend this exercise to be orbital modeling but the practice of 3-D animation.
