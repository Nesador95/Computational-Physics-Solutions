# Chapter 3: Graphics and visualization

##### Exercise 4.1
This program demonstrates the limitations of float number operations using factorials.
##### Exercise 4.2
This program tests the accuracy of operations with floats. With a quadratic equation solver, and provides a more computationally sound formula for solving quadratic equations in a computer
##### Exercise 4.3
This program shows the limitations of calculation in computers due to their rigidity with float values. Here, different iterations of a derivative are evaluated and show firsthand inaccuracies in the way the machine calculates.
##### Exercise 4.4
This program demonstrates the limits of computational speed, at least for now, with the rule of thumb, "calculations we can perform on a computer are ones that can be done with about a billion operations or less." The author asks to calculate an integral with a simple algorithm based on Riemann's definition of an integral and slice the integral until the execution time takes about 1 second. This turns out to be 5 million slices for the laptop this original code was written in. This is in contrast to the result given by 100 slices; the 100 slices program took 0.998 milliseconds (about 0.001% speed of the 5 million calculation version) but it only had a 2 digit accuracy. This change illustrates the gain in accuracy and the exponential increase in time of calculation when performing computational tasks.
